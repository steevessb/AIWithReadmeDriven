# AIWithReadmeDriven

This PowerShell-based framework provides an automated way to generate Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style tests for Azure resources using Pester. It follows a fixture-based approach that allows you to define expected resources in a structured format and automatically generates comprehensive tests to validate that your Azure deployments match these specifications. This framework connects to a real Azure subscription to validate deployed resources against your specifications.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To run the complete automated workflow:

```powershell
# Run the complete generative flow - fixtures to report
.\Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1
```

This unified script will:
1. Read fixtures from AzureFixtures.ps1
2. Generate Pester tests from these fixtures
3. Run the tests and output NUnit XML results
4. Launch the React-based report viewer at http://localhost:3001

Alternatively, you can run only specific parts:

```powershell
# Run tests and launch the report viewer (without regenerating tests)
.\Start-TestAndViewer.ps1

# Only generate tests
.\Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1 -SkipTestExecution -SkipReportViewer

# Only run tests
.\Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1 -SkipTestGeneration -SkipReportViewer

# Only view reports
.\Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1 -SkipTestGeneration -SkipTestExecution
```

This will:
1. Generate Pester tests from fixtures
2. Run the tests and output NUnit XML results
3. Launch the React-based report viewer at http://localhost:3001

> **Note**: The React report viewer processes NUnit XML test results from Pester tests. It correctly handles test results with merged attributes and displays them in a user-friendly interface with filtering options. The report viewer reads the test summary from the root `test-results` element and processes nested test cases through the results hierarchy.

## How It Works

The framework consists of several components that work together:

1. **AzureFixtures.ps1** - Contains definitions of expected Azure resources in a structured format
2. **PesterTestGenerator.ps1** - Provides functions to convert fixture data into BDD-style Pester tests
3. **GenerateTests.ps1** - Main script that orchestrates the test generation process
4. **DiscoveryPhase.ps1** - Handles discovering actual Azure resources for comparison with fixtures
5. **DeploymentsSpecification.Tests.ps1** - The output file containing the generated Pester tests

## Test Generation Process

    A[AzureFixtures.ps1] -->|Define Expected Resources| B[GenerateTests.ps1]
    B -->|Parse Fixtures| C[Find-FixtureVariables]
    B -->|Generate Tests| D[New-DescribeContextItFromExpectedFixtureVariable]
    D -->|Output Tests| E[DeploymentsSpecification.Tests.ps1]
    F[DiscoveryPhase.ps1] -->|Discover Actual Resources from Azure| E
    G[Real Azure Subscription] -->|Query Resources| F
```

This framework connects to the real Azure subscription (38801999-1ab2-462d-99e1-9db9e1d9fc8c) to validate that your deployed resources match the specifications in your fixture files.

## Fixture Format

Fixtures are defined in `AzureFixtures.ps1` using a structured array format:

```powershell
$expectedStorageAccounts = @(
    @{
        FriendlyName = "Primary Storage Account"
        Name = "mystorageacct123"
        rgName = "my-resource-group"
        Location = "westus2"
        Tier = "Standard"
    }
)
```

## Generated Tests

The framework automatically generates Pester tests with:

- **Describe blocks** - One per resource type (StorageAccount, AppService, etc.)
- **Context blocks** - One per resource instance, using the FriendlyName
- **It blocks** - One per property to be validated

## Test Runner and Reporting

The framework now includes:

- **RunPesterTests.ps1** - A script that runs tests and outputs NUnit XML results compatible with Jira Xray
- **React Report Viewer** - A web-based UI for viewing, filtering, and analyzing test results
- **Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1** - An all-in-one script that manages the entire workflow from fixtures to reports

### Unified Workflow

The new `Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1` script provides a streamlined experience:

```powershell
# Run the complete workflow with all options
.\Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1 
    [-SkipTestGeneration]     # Skip generating new tests
    [-SkipTestExecution]      # Skip running the tests
    [-SkipReportViewer]       # Skip launching the report viewer
    [-AutoConfirm]            # Skip confirmation prompts
    [-ResultsPath <path>]     # Specify custom results directory
```

### Viewing Test Results

After running the tests, you can view the results in the React-based report viewer:

```powershell
# Option 1: Use the all-in-one script
.\Start-GenerativeFlow.ps1 -SkipTestGeneration -SkipTestExecution

# Option 2: Use the dedicated viewer script
.\Start-TestAndViewer.ps1 -SkipTestGeneration

# Option 3: Start the server manually
cd report-viewer
npm install  # First time only
node server.js
# Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
```

The report viewer provides:
- Color-coded pass/fail status
- Filterable results by status and name
- Pie charts for each Describe suite section
- Detailed error information on fail from the azure cli or PS console
- Test counts and summaries
- NUnit XML formatting compatible with Jira Xray integration
- Web report will use json results instead (Powershell support json well)

## Important Implementation Notes

- **Discovery Phase Management**: The system uses a separate DiscoveryPhase.ps1 file to handle resource discovery instead of using BeforeDiscovery blocks directly in test files. This provides better separation of concerns and more flexibility in test execution.
- **Resource Loading**: Resources are loaded by importing functions from DiscoveryPhase.ps1 and calling Export-DiscoveredResources to get the discovered resources.
- **NUnit XML Output**: Test results are output in NUnit XML format, which is compatible with CI/CD pipelines and test management tools like Jira Xray.

Example of a generated test:

```powershell
Describe "StorageAccount Deployment Tests" {
    Context "Primary Storage Account Deployment Validation" -ForEach $expectedStorageAccounts {
        BeforeAll {
            $actual = $actualDeployedResources['StorageAccounts'] | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $Name }
        }
        
        It "Primary Storage Account should exist" {
            $actual | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty -Because "StorageAccount should be created"
        }
        
        It "Should be named 'mystorageacct123'" {
            $actual.Name | Should -Be $Name -Because "Resource name should match specification"
        }
        
        It "Should be in the 'my-resource-group' resource group" {
            $actual.ResourceGroupName | Should -Be $rgName -Because "Resource should be in the specified resource group"
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Features

- **Unified Workflow** - Complete end-to-end testing flow from fixtures to interactive reports
- **Automatic Test Generation** - Tests are generated based on fixture variables in AzureFixtures.ps1
- **Resource Property Detection** - Automatically detects properties to test based on fixture structure
- **Intelligent Test Updates** - Preserves existing test structure when regenerating tests
- **Resource Type Detection** - Infers resource types from fixture variable names
- **Cleanup Functionality** - Removes unused backup files and temporary files
- **Interactive Report Viewer** - Modern React-based UI for analyzing test results

## Usage

The test generation process is as simple as running the GenerateTests.ps1 script:

```powershell
./tests/GenerateTests.ps1
```

The script will:
1. Clean up any unused files
2. Discover fixture variables in AzureFixtures.ps1
3. Generate test blocks in DeploymentsSpecification.Tests.ps1 and use -ForEach with $fixtureVariable # usually an array of hashtables.
4. Preserve any existing custom code in the test file

## Benefits

- **Consistency** - Ensures consistent testing approach across all resources
- **Maintainability** - Easy to update tests when resources change
- **Readability** - Generated tests follow BDD style for better understanding
- **Extensibility** - Can be extended to support new Azure resource types
